The "Contact Form" application is a web tool that features a form with fields for first name, last name, email, and a message. When users submit the form, their input is saved in the Redux store and instantly displayed on the UI for confirmation. The application also includes unit tests to ensure the reliability and accuracy of data storage and display.
